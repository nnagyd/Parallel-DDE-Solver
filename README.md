# Parallel DDE Solver
 Parallel Delay Differential Equation solver on CPU using AVX Vector instructions, based on [VCL](https://github.com/vectorclass/version2) library.

# Requirements
- C++14 or C++17 compiler
- [VCL](https://github.com/vectorclass/version2) library version 2

# Performance

- Faster than most other codes

- Using AVX instruction set and built-in loop unrolling

- Performance on the delayed logistic equation
